# Response Awareness – Implement Blueprint

Implement strictly from an approved blueprint document and resolve all tags.

## Input

Blueprint path (markdown): $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1) Load the blueprint and allocate focused work packages to implementers.
2) Implement without mutating the plan; mark assumptions with tags.
3) Verify: tests/build/screenshots/logs; resolve every tag deterministically.
4) Final synthesis report with decisions and evidence.
