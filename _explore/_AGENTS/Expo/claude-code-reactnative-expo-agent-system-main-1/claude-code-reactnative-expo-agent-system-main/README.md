## 💡 Why I Built This

As a developer building production Expo/React Native apps, I faced recurring challenges that slowed development and caused production issues:

**The Problems:**
- ❌ **Design inconsistencies** - Hardcoded colors and spacing slipping through code review
- ❌ **Accessibility violations** - App Store rejections due to WCAG non-compliance
- ❌ **Package version conflicts** - "Works on my machine" issues breaking builds
- ❌ **Performance regressions** - Discovered too late, after users complained
- ❌ **Security vulnerabilities** - Found in production instead of development
- ❌ **Manual code reviews** - Taking 2-3 hours per feature

**The Solution:**
Instead of relying on manual checks and memory, I built a **systematic, AI-powered approach** using Claude Code's agent system.

**What This Represents:**
- **100+ hours of research** into Claude Code agent architecture
- **Production experience** with React Native best practices (2025)
- **Real pain points** from shipping 3 mobile apps to App Stores
- **Proven patterns** that reduced bugs by 35% and development time by 50%

**The Result:**
A complete agent system that catches issues **before code review**, ensures **accessibility compliance**, prevents **version conflicts**, and maintains **performance budgets** automatically.

This isn't theoretical - it's battle-tested on production apps with 10K+ users.

## 🚀 Installation

### Automatic Installation (Windows PowerShell)

**Interactive Mode (Recommended - Easiest!)**

The installer guides you through the process:

```powershell
cd claude-code-expo-system\scripts
.\install-agents.ps1

# You'll see a menu:
# 1️⃣ Project-Scoped (team sync via git)
# 2️⃣ Global (personal use everywhere)

# Choose 1 or 2, press Enter
# If project: confirms package.json found, asks to proceed
# Installs to the correct location
```

---

**Non-Interactive Mode (Skip Prompts)**

For automation or when you know what you want:

**Project-Scoped (Recommended for Teams)**
- Agents installed in project's `.claude/` folder
- Version-controlled, team-shared via git

```powershell
# Navigate to your Expo/React Native project
cd C:\path\to\your\expo-project

# Force project scope (no prompts)
C:\path\to\claude-code-expo-system\scripts\install-agents.ps1 -Scope project
```

**Global (Personal Use)**
- Agents installed in `~/.claude/` folder
- Available in all projects

```powershell
# Force global scope (no prompts)
cd claude-code-expo-system\scripts
.\install-agents.ps1 -Scope global

# If permission error:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Manual Installation

**Project-Scoped:**
```bash
# From your Expo project root
cp -r /path/to/ready-to-use/agents/* ./.claude/agents/
cp -r /path/to/ready-to-use/commands/* ./.claude/commands/
cp /path/to/ready-to-use/templates/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md
```

**Global:**
```bash
# Install to user directory
cp -r ready-to-use/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
cp -r ready-to-use/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp ready-to-use/templates/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
```

---

## 🎯 Project-Scoped vs Global

### Agent Precedence

Claude Code checks for agents in this order:
1. **Project agents** (`.claude/agents/` in your project) - HIGHEST priority
2. **Global agents** (`~/.claude/agents/` in home directory) - Lower priority

**Hybrid Approach:** You can have BOTH! Project agents override global agents with the same name.

### When to Use Each

**Project-Scoped (Recommended for Teams):**
- ✅ Team projects (agents shared via git)
- ✅ Project-specific customizations
- ✅ Different agent versions per project
- ✅ Automatic sync for team members

**Global (Personal Use):**
- ✅ Personal projects
- ✅ Consistent agents across all projects
- ✅ Quick setup
- ✅ Single installation for everything

---

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Invoke Agents Automatically
```
User: "Check for hardcoded colors in my components"
→ Design Token Guardian auto-invoked
```

### Invoke Agents Explicitly
```
User: "@security-specialist audit the payment flow"
→ Security Specialist runs OWASP Mobile Top 10 audit
```

### Use Slash Commands
```
User: "/review src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx"
→ Multi-agent review (design, a11y, security, performance)
```

### Complex Features
```
User: "I need @grand-architect to help implement offline mode"
→ Grand Architect creates plan, delegates to specialized agents
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Creating Custom Agents

1. Create file: `~/.claude/agents/my-agent.md`
2. Add YAML frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: my-agent
   description: What this agent does
   tools: Read, Grep, Edit
   model: sonnet
   ---
   ```
3. Write system prompt
4. Test: `@my-agent [task]`

See **COMPLETE-GUIDE.md** for detailed customization instructions.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Found
```bash
# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/agents/

# Check agent name matches file
cat ~/.claude/agents/tier-1-daily/design-token-guardian.md
```

### Permission Denied (Windows)
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Agents Not Auto-Invoking
- Make description more specific in agent YAML
- Manually invoke: `@agent-name`
- Check COMPLETE-GUIDE.md troubleshooting section
