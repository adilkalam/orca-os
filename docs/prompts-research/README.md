# Prompts Research (Historical)

This folder contains **research and analysis documents** used while designing
OS 2.2 prompts, quality heuristics, and agent behaviors.

These docs are valuable for understanding *why* certain prompt/agent patterns
exist, but they are not the canonical OS 2.2 specification.

- For current behavior, see:
  - `docs/architecture/vibe-code-os-v2-spec.md`
  - `docs/pipelines/*`
  - `docs/reference/*`
  - `agents/*.md`

Treat everything under `docs/prompts-research/` as **historical / background**
unless a specific file is referenced from the core docs.
