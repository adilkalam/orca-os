## 4. MCP Configuration

### MCP Server Check (~/.claude/settings.json)

#VERIFICATION_FAILED: settings.local.json MISSING
- Expected: ~/.claude/settings.local.json
- Found: ~/.claude/settings.json (no mcpServers config)
- Status: ❌ MISSING MCP CONFIGURATION

### settings.json Current State:
- Has hooks: ✅ (SessionStart, SessionEnd)
- Has statusLine: ✅
- Has enabledPlugins: ✅
- Has mcpServers: ❌ MISSING

**Expected MCP Servers:**
1. vibe-memory
2. puppeteer
3. sequential-thinking
4. playwright
5. chrome-devtools
6. ahrefs
7. context7
8. bright-data-web

**MCP Configuration: ❌ FAILED (0/8 servers configured)**

---

## Executive Summary

### Passed Components (11/12)
✅ Agent Configuration (4/4)
✅ Command Configuration (3/3)
✅ Evidence Capture Scripts (4/4)

### Failed Components (1/12)
❌ MCP Configuration (0/8)

### Overall Verdict: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL PASS

**Blocking Issue:**
- MCP servers not configured in settings.json
- No settings.local.json with mcpServers section

**Recommendation:**
Add mcpServers configuration to ~/.claude/settings.json or create ~/.claude/settings.local.json with MCP server definitions.

**Non-Blocking:**
- All agents, commands, and scripts properly configured
- ORCA can function for file operations, but MCP-dependent features unavailable

---

## Next Steps

1. Configure MCP servers in settings.json
2. Verify MCP tools available (puppeteer, sequential-thinking, etc.)
3. Re-run verification to confirm full system operational
