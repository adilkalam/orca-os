## 1. Executive Overview
Dual-Axis Recomposition is a systems-level approach to body recomposition designed for athletes and high-control trainees who need simultaneous fat loss and muscle preservation (or gain). Instead of relying on simplistic caloric-deficit logic, the protocol synchronizes two daily metabolic axes:
- **Daytime AMPK axis** – catabolic, fat-mobilizing, performance-focused.
- **Retatrutide Metabolic Foundation** (content)
  > # Retatrutide as Metabolic Foundation

## Overview

Retatrutide represents a fundamental approach to metabolic regulation, acting through three distinct receptor pathways:

## 3.2 Retatrutide — The Command Signal

**What it is:** Retatrutide activates three distinct receptors—GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon—that govern how we eat, burn, and store fuel.
- peptide:retatrutide —[inhibits]→ mech:mTOR
  > AOD-9604 → unlocks resistant fat stores
L-CARNITINE → ensures liberated fat becomes fuel
TESAMORELIN (± IPAMORELIN) → protects and rebuilds structure
