      "summary": "Semax\nSemax is a medication which is used in Russia and Eastern Europe for the treatment of a broad range of conditions like brain trauma but predominantly for its claimed nootropic, neuroprotective, and neurorestorative effects.[1]\nThe mechanism of action of Semax is unknown.[2][3] It might interact with certain melanocortin receptors or inhibit enkephalinase enzymes.[2][3] Chemically, Semax is a peptide and a synthetic analogue of a fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).[4][5]\nSemax was first described by 1991.[5] Although used as a prescription drug in Russia and Eastern Europe, Semax has not been evaluated, approved for use, or marketed in most other countries.[6][7] The drug is widely sold by online vendors and used as a purported nootropic (cognitive enhancer).[1][8]\nMedical uses\n[edit]Semax has undergone extensive study in Russia and is on the Russian List of Vital & Essential Drugs approved by the Russian Federation government on 7 December 2011.[9] Medical uses for Semax include treatment of stroke, transient ischemic attack, memory and cognitive disorders, peptic ulcers, optic nerve disease, and to boost the immune system.[10][11][12][13]\nPharmacology\n[edit]Pharmacodynamics\n[edit]In animals, Semax rapidly elevates the levels and expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its signaling receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in the hippocampus,[14] and rapidly activates serotonergic and dopaminergic brain systems.[15][16] Accordingly, it has been found to produce antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects,[17][18] attenuate the behavioral effects of exposure to chronic stress,[17][18] and potentiate the locomotor activity produced by D-amphetamine.[16][19] As such, it has been suggested that Semax may be effective in the treatment of depression.[20]\nThough the exact mechanism of action of Semax is unclear, there is evidence that it may act through melanocortin receptors. Specifically, there is a report of Semax competitively antagonizing the action of \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) at the MC4 and MC5 receptors in both in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions, indicating that it may act as an antagonist or partial agonist of these receptors. [2] Semax did not antagonize \u03b1-MSH at the MC3 receptor, though this receptor could still be a target of the drug.[2] As for the MC1 and MC2 receptors, they were not assayed.[2]\nIn addition to actions at receptors, Semax, as well as a related peptide drug, Selank, have been found to inhibit enzymes involved in the degradation of enkephalins and other endogenous regulatory peptides (IC50 = 10 \u03bcM), though the clinical significance of this property is uncertain.[3]\nPharmacokinetics\n[edit]As a peptide, Semax has poor oral bioavailability and hence is administered parenterally as a nasal spray or subcutaneous injection. Chemistry\n[edit]Semax is a heptapeptide and synthetic analogue of a fragment of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), ACTH (4-10), of the following amino acid sequence: Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro (MEHFPGP in single-letter form).[4]\nHistory\n[edit]Semax was first described in scientific literature by 1991.[5]\nSociety and culture\n[edit]Etymology\n[edit]Semax is composed of seven amino acid residues: Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro (MEHFPGP), which is reflected in the name - from an abbreviation of \"seven amino acids\"\u2014in Russian: \u0421\u0415\u041c\u044c \u0410\u043c\u0438\u043d\u043e\u041a\u0438\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0442\u2014\u0421\u0415\u041c\u0410\u041a\u0421. Marketing\n[edit]Semax was developed, produced, and marketed by Peptogen in the Russian Federation with participation of the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences.[citation needed]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ a b Voronina TA (2023).",

      "summary": "In addition to cognition, Semax will also increase tolerance to hypoxic conditions, enhance cerebral blood flow, and production of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF), a protein for the survival of neurons and growth of neurons. It also alters the expression of genes of main messenger systems-GABA subunits, transporters, ion channels, and dopamine and serotonin receptors-explaining its calm-yet-clear \u201cfeel.\u201d\nSelank also appears to influence the immune system. At the cognitive level, animal studies associate Selank with increased sensory attention, improved learning, and more typical exploratory behavior-comparable to reports from users who have stable concentration as well as decreased anxious tension. Accounts indicate that BDNF has been shown to be increased significantly following Semax, with significant upregulation of the trkB receptor-the main BDNF receptor found on certain neurons-which can account for subsequent impacts upon plasticity and repair. Overall, Semax is optimally administered for personal cognitive or neurological enhancement in the short term, while Selank is optimally administered for sustained emotional stability and stress reduction through repeated series of brief cycles with recovery intervals between them.",
