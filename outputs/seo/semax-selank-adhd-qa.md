# QA · Semax Selank ADHD

Generated for: outputs/seo/semax-selank-adhd-draft.md

## Summary
The draft is structurally solid and grounded in your curated research and knowledge graph. It correctly frames Semax (BDNF/monoamines) and Selank (GABA/anxiolytic) as adjunct options with compliance guardrails. The main gaps are citations, internal links, and a few SEO/polish items (title case, meta, CTA).

## Critical Fixes (must‑do before hand‑off)
- [ ] Citations: Replace all `[TODO]` markers with primary sources; add at least 2 citations in Intro and 2–3 in Evidence. Prefer PubMed/PMC.
- [ ] Title case: Change H1 to “Semax Selank ADHD: Evidence‑Based Alternatives for ADHD and Anxiety” (capitalize ADHD).
- [ ] Inline evidence tags: Convert `[KG: …]` and `[Curated]` labels into real references or remove after citations are inserted.
- [ ] Internal links: Link first mentions of “Semax” and “Selank” to internal cards; add 1–2 relevant internal links in Evidence/Practical sections (see below).
- [ ] Compliance: Keep “Not FDA‑approved” statements; add a one‑line FDA/medical supervision disclaimer near the top as well as at the end.
- [ ] Sedation claims: Where “non‑sedating” is stated for Selank, add a supporting citation or soften language.
- [ ] Protocol language: Keep non‑prescriptive tone; avoid specific dosing numbers unless cited and clearly labeled as research‑context examples.
- [ ] Add CTA: Human‑edited next step (e.g., “Discuss options with your clinician; review our ADHD foundations guide”).

## Evidence To Insert (minimal viable set)
- Semax – dopamine/BDNF/cognition: PubMed 16996699 (review cited in curated notes).
- Selank – GABAergic/anxiolytic profile: PMC4757669 (open‑access review cited in curated notes).
- Optional: Additional human data points if available in your notes (e.g., small cognitive performance trials or anxiety scales); otherwise, keep claims conservative.

Suggested inline format: “...improves executive function in selected contexts [PubMed: 16996699].” and “...non‑sedating anxiolysis patterns [PMC: 4757669].”

## Internal Links To Add (knowledge graph)
- Semax card → `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/peptides/cards/semax-card.md`
- Selank card → `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/peptides/cards/selank-card.md`
- Cognitive Axis overview → `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/content/system_master/5-cognitive-axis.md`
- AK 4‑Week protocol references (context, not prescriptive) → `/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/protocols/ak_4week_protocol_updated.md`

Placement
- First mention of each peptide (What/Mechanisms) → link to the peptide cards.
- Evidence section → link to Cognitive Axis page where BDNF/GABA relations are highlighted.
- Practical section → context link to AK 4‑Week protocol (do not imply direction to self‑treat).

## SEO Checks
- H1 keyword: present; fix capitalization (“ADHD”).
- H2 coverage: Intro; What; Mechanisms; Evidence; Dosing/Safety; Practical; Conclusion → ✅ matches plan.
- Meta description: add to brief and reuse in CMS (≤156 chars; benefit‑oriented, non‑medical claims).
- Internal links: add 3–5 (see above). External links: 2–4 (PubMed/PMC only).
- PAA intent: Answer “What is Semax?”, “How does Selank work?”, “Are they FDA‑approved?”, “Do they help ADHD/anxiety?” within first 500–700 words.
- Schema (optional): Article schema with author, dateModified; MedicalEntity mentions only if your CMS supports it and compliance allows.

## E‑E‑A‑T & Compliance
- [ ] Add author byline + credentials (or editorial board credit) and last‑reviewed date.
- [ ] Add “Not FDA‑approved; research compounds” note in Intro.
- [ ] Keep disclaimer at end; add one sentence near top as well.
- [ ] Where claims are mechanistic, label as preclinical vs. human; avoid over‑generalization.

## Freshness & Refresh Triggers
- New RCTs on Semax/Selank; FDA/regulatory changes; guidance on peptide compounding or supply chain.
- Yearly refresh for keyword trends; quarterly review if traffic/engagement is high.

## Editorial TODOs (inline targets)
- [ ] Intro: insert 2–3 citations (Semax BDNF/monoamines; Selank GABA/anxiolysis).
- [ ] Evidence: add 2–3 human data points or clearly mark as preclinical where applicable.
- [ ] Dosing/Safety: keep high‑level; if adding ranges, cite and mark as research‑context; otherwise, remove specifics.
- [ ] Practical: add one paragraph on measurement (task initiation, time‑on‑task, GAD‑7/PHQ‑9 under clinician oversight).
- [ ] Conclusion: add link to an ADHD foundations piece or clinic intake page (internal).

## Quick Diff Checklist (mechanical)
- [ ] H1 capitalization → “ADHD”.
- [ ] Replace `[KG: …]` and `[Curated]` with citations or delete.
- [ ] Add 3–5 internal links + 2–4 PubMed/PMC links.
- [ ] Keep disclaimer in both Intro and end.
- [ ] Final pass for hedging language (“may”, “emerging evidence”, “in select contexts”).
