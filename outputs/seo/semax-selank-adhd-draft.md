# Semax Selank ADHD: Evidence-Based Alternatives for ADHD and Anxiety

## Introduction: Overview of Semax Selank ADHD

Two research peptides, [Semax](/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/peptides/cards/semax-card.md) and [Selank](/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/peptides/cards/selank-card.md), are often discussed as non‑sedating options for focus and calm.

Semax and Selank for ADHD/anxiety: mechanisms (BDNF, GABA), safety, and research‑context intranasal dosing under clinician guidance.

*Focus:* What & why; clinician oversight

Semax and Selank present a contrast to traditional psychotropic medications in ADHD and anxiety treatment, respectively. Below we compare their efficacy, onset/duration, tolerability, safety, and other attributes against standard drugs (stimulants for ADHD, and benzodiazepines for anxiety). ADHD is conventionally managed with stimulant medications like **Adderall** (mixed amphetamine salts) and **Vyvanse** (lisdexamfetamine). These increase synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, leading to enhanced executive function and attention]( For acute anxiety and stress-related disorders, **benzodiazepines** such as **Xanax** (alprazolam) are commonly used. These drugs potentiate GABA_A receptor activity to produce rapid anxiolysis, but at the cost of sedation, cognitive impairment, and dependency risk.

*Focus:* Definitions & regulatory status

## How it works (mechanisms)

*Focus:* Semax→BDNF; Selank→GABA

Below we compare their efficacy, onset/duration, tolerability, safety, and other attributes against standard drugs (stimulants for ADHD, and benzodiazepines for anxiety). ADHD is conventionally managed with stimulant medications like **Adderall** (mixed amphetamine salts) and **Vyvanse** (lisdexamfetamine). These increase synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, leading to enhanced executive function and attention]( **Semax -- Neurotrophic & Cognitive Mechanisms:** Semax is a synthetic heptapeptide (Met-Glu-His-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro) derived from the ACTH(4--10) fragment, engineered to have no hormonal activity]( It acts as a **neurotrophic modulator**, rapidly elevating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and expression of its TrkB receptors in the hippocampus](

## Evidence and research

*Focus:* Preclinical + small human studies

Semax and Selank present a contrast to traditional psychotropic medications in ADHD and anxiety treatment, respectively. Below we compare their efficacy, onset/duration, tolerability, safety, and other attributes against standard drugs (stimulants for ADHD, and benzodiazepines for anxiety). While Semax and Selank show great promise, it is crucial to acknowledge **limitations and gaps** in our current knowledge: - **Research Quality and Quantity:** Much of the evidence for Semax and Selank comes from Russian studies, some of which are not widely published in English-language journals. Sample sizes in human trials have been modest (dozens of patients), and replication by independent Western research groups is scarce. **Cognitive Enhancement and ADHD:** While comprehensive human trials are limited, small studies and reports shed light on Semax's cognitive effects. In one study of eight human subjects, a **single dose of Semax significantly improved cognitive function** on testing, suggesting acute nootropic properties](

## Dosing, safety, and side effects

*Focus:* Intranasal ranges; safety; disclaimers

Below we compare their efficacy, onset/duration, tolerability, safety, and other attributes against standard drugs (stimulants for ADHD, and benzodiazepines for anxiety). ADHD is conventionally managed with stimulant medications like **Adderall** (mixed amphetamine salts) and **Vyvanse** (lisdexamfetamine). These increase synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, leading to enhanced executive function and attention]( Beyond their individual effects, Semax and Selank may be **combined with other cutting-edge therapies** to create synergistic "stacks" aimed at neuroprotection, enhanced neuroplasticity, and stress resilience. These stacks are theoretical or in early research phases, but they align mechanistically.

Research‑context dosing examples (non‑prescriptive)

- Semax (intranasal): 300–900 µg per day in divided doses, reassess after 2–4 weeks. Example program shows 600–900 µg/day blocks. ([AK 4‑Week Protocol](/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/protocols/ak-4-week-protocol.md))
- Selank (intranasal): 200–400 µg per day in divided doses, reassess after 2–4 weeks. Example program shows 300–400 µg/day blocks. ([AK 4‑Week Protocol](/Users/adilkalam/Desktop/OBDN/obdn_site/docs/protocols/ak-4-week-protocol.md))

## Practical use and protocols

*Focus:* Adjunct use; tracking; supervision

Semax and Selank present a contrast to traditional psychotropic medications in ADHD and anxiety treatment, respectively. Below we compare their efficacy, onset/duration, tolerability, safety, and other attributes against standard drugs (stimulants for ADHD, and benzodiazepines for anxiety). ADHD is conventionally managed with stimulant medications like **Adderall** (mixed amphetamine salts) and **Vyvanse** (lisdexamfetamine). These increase synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex, leading to enhanced executive function and attention]( Considering the distinct properties of Semax and Selank, one can envisage their use in **phased cognitive enhancement or recovery protocols**, where different interventions are prioritized at different stages or for specific goals: - **Acute Focus Phase (Immediate Cognitive Boost):** In scenarios like studying for an exam, intense work sprints, or any need for sharp focus on demand, Semax could be utilized as a rapid nootropic. An intranasal dose of Semax before a mentally demanding task may improve concentration and working memory without the jitteriness of caffeine or amphetamines](
